# darp-analyzer

This is a high-level, easy-to-use, easy-to-scalate data analysis tool for DARP data. It is presented as an easy-to-deploy webapp programmed in python.

It uses **streamlit**, an open source python library for webapp designing. Everything is programmed in python so it is familiar to data scientists that might not have experience with html/web design.

# How to Run It

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
    * **streamlit 0.83 or higher**
    * **Pandas**
    * **PyDeck**
    * **numpy**
2. Run `python make.py`. This must be done only the very first time that you execute this webapp.
3. Run `streamlit run darp_analyzer_webapp.py`
